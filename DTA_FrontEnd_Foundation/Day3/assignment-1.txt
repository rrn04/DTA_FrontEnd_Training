Q: Why do we use value attribute of <option> tag ?
Q: What is <input type="hidden" /> ? why do we use it ?
Q: What is difference between <input type="submit"/> and <button> </button>

1.
The value attribute specifies the value to be sent to a server when a form is submitted.
The content between the opening <option> and closing </option> tags is what the browsers will display in a drop-down list. However, the value of the value attribute is what will be sent to the server when a form is submitted.

2.
The <input type="hidden"> defines a hidden input field.
A hidden field lets web developers include data that cannot be seen or modified by users when a form is submitted.
A hidden field often stores what database record that needs to be updated when the form is submitted.



3.
<input type="button" /> buttons will not submit a form - they don't do anything by default. They're generally used in conjunction with JavaScript as part of an AJAX application.

<input type="submit"> buttons will submit the form they are in when the user clicks on them, unless you specify otherwise with JavaScript.
