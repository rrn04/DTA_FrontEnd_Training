JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation 
JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page 
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
JSON data is written as name/value pairs.
A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value: "firstName":"John"

In JavaScript, an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is called a property.
JavaScript array is a single variable that is used to store different elements.
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

var emp = {empno: 1234, ename: "Johnson", job:"Accountant", salary: 2000000, email:"charles.morris@yahoo.in", deptno: 0487};
