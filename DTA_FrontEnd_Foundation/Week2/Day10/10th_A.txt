A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems that occur in software design. 
The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects. 
The idea is to speed up the development process by providing well-tested, proven development/design paradigms. 
Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving a common problem. 
Goal: 
Understand the purpose and usage of each design pattern in order to pick and implement the correct pattern as needed.
