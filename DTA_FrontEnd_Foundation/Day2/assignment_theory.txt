1: What is the difference between get/post methods in form tag?
2: What is Querystring?
3: Why do we use ~ and > in css selectors?

1.
	GET method - used to request data from a specified resource
	The HTTP GET method adds a query string at the end of the URL to send data to the server. The query string 	is in the form of key-value pair followed by ? symbol.
	
	POST method - used to send data to a server to update a resource
	When we submit the form, it will add the user input data to the body of the request sent to the server.
	

2.
	A query string is the portion of a URL where data is passed to a web application and/or back-end database. The reason we need query strings is that the HTTP protocol is stateless by design. For a website to be anything more than a brochure, you need to maintain state (store data). There are a number of ways to do this: On most web servers, you can use something like session state server-side. On the client, you can store via cookies. Or in the URL, you can store data via a query string.


3.
The greater than sign (>) selector in CSS is used to select the element with a specific parent. 
It is called as element > element selector. It is also known as the child combinator selector which means that it selects only those elements which are direct children of a parent. 
It looks only one level down the markup structure and not further deep down. Elements which are not the direct child of the specified parent is not selected.

The tilde symbol(~) is known as subsequent-sibling combinator, which separates two compound selectors. 
The elements that are represented by the two compound selectors have the same parent element. 
The first selector precedes (but not necessarily immediately) the element that is represented by the second selector.
